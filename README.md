## Overview

Secretary is an SMS-based personal assistant with natural language processing and Internet-of-Things integration.  More documentation coming soon(TM)

## Technologies Used

The core server runs on Node.js.  We use Twilio to communicate with users, Microsoft BotBuilder and LUIS for language understanding, and Cylon for Internet-of-Things integration.  Currently Cylon only supports Nest and Bluetooth(which isn't even functional yet).
